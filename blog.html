        <p> I have designed a photography website.
            <br><br>
            I designed this website from the ground up. I found the design process challenging at times it was a great
            experience to learn and develop my skills as a developer. I started off by drawing a flow-chart mapping out
            the different areas of every web page which will be created. On the website, I have included a home, about
            me, gallery and contents pages. Each page will have a navigation bar and footer bar with social media icons.
            <br><br>
            I started of my designs on paper as you can see from the image below
            <br><br>
            I used Adobe XD as my main design programme to create a wireframe on how the website is going to look once
            it is completed. As you can see from the screenshots below I have designed different layouts to go on to the
            different web pages. After wireframing my designs I used colours, logos and images to get an idea of how I
            wanted the website to look.
            <br><br>
            The pages went through alot of design changes throughout the development of this project because they were
            not user friendly and the overall experience was bad. By changing locations of images, navbar designs,
            gallery selection and layout it made the UI easy to use.
            <br><br>
            The about me page was a simple design which only needed a few pictures and some text which explained to the
            viewer who the photographer is as you can see from the image below this was the final design of the page.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, the contact page was also another challenge to complete. I have linked an email to the web page
            directly for people to interact with. The form is used to interact with a view also as you can see from the
            form it is very basic which consists of a name, email, subject and message.
            <br><br>
            The gallery section of the website was the most challenging to complete. It went through a lot of design
            changes until I found the right one. As you can see I have used a lightbox in the final product of the
            gallery which makes the images interactive and the user is able to see the images more clearly which they
            click on the image. I used javascript to design the gallery and control the functions. .
            <br><br>
            Overall I am very pleased with the final design of the website and I followed the brief.
