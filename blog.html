        <p>I set out to build a website for a photographer who wanted to display their work. The client wanted an
            interactive website featuring an introduction page, gallery section and a page where people could contact
            them.
            <br><br>
            I started by drawing my ideas onto pieces of paper which would help me with wireframing at a later stage. As
            you can see from the images below. I have included a home, about, gallery and contact section of the web
            page.
            Each page consists of having a responsive navigation bar which response to mobile, laptop and desktop
            devices. As you can see from my drawings I have placed images and text on each page to give me an idea of
            the layout I need. I stuck to the clients brief and made it responsive.
            <br><br>
            Wireframing was the next stage in the design process. I used Adobe XD to design a wireframe for the website.
            As you can see from the screenshots below I have designed various layouts for the website which include,
            navigation bars, footer bars, logo placement and social media icon placement. Each web page has the same
            navigation and footer placement on the page this was to ensure the design was consistent throughout the
            project.
            <br><br>
            After completing the wire-framing process I moved onto the design by using images and colours provided by
            the client and sticking to the brief and as you can see from the images below, these are my final designs
            for the web page. I used Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to design the logo for the client.
            <br><br>
            I used VS code as my main coding software. I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript coding languages in this
            project as you can see from the screenshots below.

            While I was coding and seeing the designs come to life. I noticed a few changes which needed to happen. I
            changed the look of the navigation bar because it was not user friendly so I moved the logo from the centre
            of the navigation bar to the left and the links to the other pages to the right. As you can see from the
            screenshots and drawings below.
            <br><br>
            The gallery section needed to be changed. As you can see from the original design all the pictures are close
            together on one page. This needed to be changed because it was not responsive enough for the idea I was
            trying to create. I drew a new gallery web page on paper where the photos were split apart and when the user
            clicked onto the photo it would appear in a light-box which enlarged the photos to their original size. This
            worked on mobiles, laptops and desktops therefore making the gallery section responsive which kept to the
            client brief.
            I changed the design of the contact section because it was very basic in design and did not match the design
            of the rest of the site. As you can see from the screenshots below of the changes.
            <br><br>
            In conclusion, the product I designed for my client was kept to the brief and is a fully functioning
            interactive web page.
